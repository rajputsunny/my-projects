The streamlined interface powered by Streamlit makes the entire process effortless, ensuring accurate results without the need for complex interactions.

## Technologies Used

- Machine Learning
- Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm
- Streamlit API

## Key Features

- **Precise Classification**: The Spam Classifier's standout feature is its unparalleled precision of 100%. This means that every classification decision it makes is confidently accurate.

- **High Accuracy**: With an overall accuracy rate of 95%, you can trust the Spam Classifier to reliably identify and categorize incoming messages.

- **Effortless Interaction**: The integration of the Streamlit API offers a user-friendly interface where users can effortlessly input messages for classification.

## How It Works

Here's a breakdown of how the Spam Classifier operates:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: The system collects and preprocesses SMS and e-mail data, ensuring a well-structured dataset.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Using advanced techniques, the system extracts meaningful features from the text data, capturing the essence of both spam and legitimate messages.

3. **Model Training**: The Naive Bayes classification algorithm undergoes training on the labeled dataset, enabling it to discern patterns that differentiate spam from non-spam.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Leveraging the Streamlit API, users can easily input messages they want to classify without any technical hassle.

5. **Accurate Classification**: Based on the trained patterns, the system accurately classifies each input message as either spam or not spam.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Spam Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpamClassifier.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SpamClassifier`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` after launching the Streamlit app.
2. Input the SMS or e-mail you wish to classify.
3. Click the "Classify" button.
4. The system will promptly display the classification result â€“ whether the input is categorized as spam or not spam.
